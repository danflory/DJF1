check LifeSpan Speed
1. measure the length of the bed = bedLength
2. 528 feet per tenth of a mile . testLengthFeet

3. testLengthInches = testLengthFeet * 12.
4. dotsToCount = testLengthInches / bedLength
5. set one mile per hour. 

in 6 minutes it should be dotsToCount. 
in .6 minutes or 36seconds it should be dotsToCount/10

The time to make one length
inchesPerMile = 5280*12
fractionOfMilePerBelt = inchesPerMile/bedLength
timePerMile = 3600 seconds
timePerBelt = timePerMile * fractionOfMilePerBelt

6. setUp a beeper timer at interveral = timePerBelt
7. click the timer start with the dots in 
a visible spot. The sound should always have be
with the dots in the same spot.
