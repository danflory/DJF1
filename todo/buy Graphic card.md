* is 100 more for 1070 with cooler worth it?

* the best cooled 1060 24/7 is a big demand

Since I'll stick with 1060 then EVGA fits. $243 probably a 6GB not sure.but will be poorly cooled, s**o now I have to research the best overclocking cards so that at normal speed they will keep cooler!**



## ~~watercooling is probably needed~~

~~I will save on the nearly the price of the cooler by getting a lower price 1060 that wouldn't cool.~~

this is said to work on 1060 thermosphere universal gpu

The same company: EK has $159 then you need the block so $200 for the cooling..... I guess not for me.
