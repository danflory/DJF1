  * the directory of .bashrc is C:\Program Files\Git\etc\bash.bashrc
  * it is modified according to install instructions, first to add the program directory to the path then to add alias t
  * alias t instructions used the command <span>./todo.sh </span>; but in other directories this should have been just <span>todo.sh</span>, I did just put it in the path.
