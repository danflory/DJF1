# note: my computer crashed

windows susggested it was os, but...
on restart I had to go to basics
* only single OS disk and monitor OK
* mouse 1 monitor, keyboard. OK
* second monitor OK BUT only at computer not using the MMK switch
* 
When I unhooked the monitors today it stoped again.
Theory: I had a loose power cord. When I tried restarting it failed.
