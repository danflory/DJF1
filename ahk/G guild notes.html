<p> from:Bee <br> Hi DJ. The problme we have is not enoug hgoods in lower ages for GBG. As you cna see we are a high level GBG guild. You would beed to add 2000 goods a day to treasurty and I don't think you cna do that. We do have a sister guild though where
    you can grow and you will be added to the same 1.9 thread we use. The guild name is "Cru" and Noomis is the leader. That is where you need to be. If you are still in this guild Monday evenig I will have to drop you. sorry just our rules if you see
    the guild rules. You get a level 80 arc you cna come join no prob</p>
