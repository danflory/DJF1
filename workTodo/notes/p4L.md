# test sync process

Commit is always needed to get changes local.

    * if new files like notes exist I have to use git outside of the t command for now, Make a todo to fix that

after a commit then you need to push

so the process is.
t sync - probably just once every computer change

t commit
t push

and t sync should report all is ok
