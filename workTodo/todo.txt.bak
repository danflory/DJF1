+href https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/wiki totxtWiki
+Jhatoday +CSWP +News.Archive.Item format code 'Item_OneLIneForNewsArchive.html'
+remember +href use this url for decoding html entity https://mothereff.in/html-entities
+remember addr expects one blank line end and uses previous
+remember:  repeat can do then extend due date by using + normal is re-entr days from now
+remember:  the search item can find a tag just use the excape '(A'
+remember: add an extra space to a new entry if you want it to sort to the top
+remember: for repeating the priority will be stripped so habits and such need a list I am swithing the m to @habit
+remember: if you forget to escape a quote ctrl-c then the up arrow retrievs the first line.
+remember: OneNote link to local page weekly @repeating
+remember: the info button helps
+remember: the pattern for the repeat action is ITEM daysForward
+remember: use browser history more
+remember: use the onenote back button top left
+remember: use VS Code "format section" for html inside of aspx
+remember: vsCode does a nice job sorting the todo.txt
