+decide: do I want to have my tag: as first thing or @ as first or +tag as first when and why +A the + highlights if VS Code use it
+decide: is @repeating the same as @habit or not?
+decide: just add +href to the end to keep a link without priority it will stay off todo
+issue: track down the markdos server error is this the same thing? https://www.mkdocs.org/
+remember:  the search item can find a tag just use the excape '(A'
+remember  repeat can do then extend due date by using + normal is re-entr days from now
+remember: add an extra space to a new entry if you want it to sort to the top
+remember: for repeating the priority will be stripped so habits and such need a list I am swithing the m to @habit
+remember: if you forget to escape a quote ctrl-c then the up arrow retrievs the first line.
+remember: OneNote link to local page weekly @repeating
+remember: the info button helps
+remember: the pattern for the repeat action is ITEM daysForward
+remember: use browser history more
+remember: use the onenote back button top left
+remember: vsCode does a nice job sorting the todo.txt
