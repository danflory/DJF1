2018-09-06 regular breaks @habit
2018-09-06 start that phone @habit
x 2018-09-05 09:22 remember: log the meetings and time
remember: for repeating the priority will be stripped so habits and such need a list I am swithing the m to @habit
issue: for sorting I gues I have to use my sytem like on this line.
(B) I need a system to keep notes on repeating tasks. I guess I'll modify the note action for my own purpose
remember: if you forget to excape a quote ctrl-c then the up arrow retrievs the first line.
x 2018-09-05 09:33 first off I had to recover my todo.sh I don't have any idea where it went.
