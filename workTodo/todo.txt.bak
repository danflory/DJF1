x 2018-09-07 15:17 +Jhatoday +CSWP +News.Archive.Item format code 'Item_OneLIneForNewsArchive.html'
+remember use this url for decoding html entity https://mothereff.in/html-entities
+remember addr expects one blank line end and uses previous
+remember repeat can do then extend due date by using + normal is re-entr days from now
+remember the search item can find a tag just use the excape '(A'
+remember add an extra space to a new entry if you want it to sort to the top
+remember for repeating the priority will be stripped so habits and such need a list I am swithing the m to @habit
+remember if you forget to escape a quote ctrl-c then the up arrow retrievs the first line.
+remember OneNote link to local page weekly @repeating
+remember the info button helps
+remember the pattern for the repeat action is ITEM daysForward
+remember use browser history more
+remember use the onenote back button top left
+remember use VS Code "format section" for html inside of aspx
+remember vsCode does a nice job sorting the todo.txt
