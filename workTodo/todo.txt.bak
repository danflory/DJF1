remeber: the search item can find a tag just use the excape '(A'
remember: for repeating the priority will be stripped so habits and such need a list I am swithing the m to @habit
remember: if you forget to excape a quote ctrl-c then the up arrow retrievs the first line.
remember: just add +href to the end to keep a link without priority it will stay off todo
remember: OneNote link to local page weekly @repeating
remember: the pattern repeat ITEM days
remember: use browser history more
remember: use the onenote back button top left
remember: vsCode does a nice job sorting the todo.txt
